## DOM Manager

The Flow.js DOM Manager provides two-way data bindings from your project's user interface to the channel. The DOM Manager is the 'glue' through which HTML DOM elements -- including the attributes and attribute handlers provided by Flow.js for [variables](../../attributes-overview/), [operations](../../operations-overview/) and [conversion](../../converter-overview/), and those [you create](./attributes/attribute-manager/) -- are bound to the variable and operations [channels](../../channel-overview/) to link them with your project's model. See the [Epicenter architecture details](../../../creating_your_interface/arch_details/) for a visual description of how the DOM Manager relates to the [rest of the Epicenter stack](../../../creating_your_interface/).

The DOM Manager is an integral part of the Flow.js architecture but, in keeping with our general philosophy of extensibility and configurability, it is also replaceable. For instance, if you want to manage your DOM state with [Backbone Views](http://backbonejs.org) or [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org), while still using the channels to handle the communication with your model, this is the piece you'd replace. [Contact us](http://forio.com/about/contact/) if you are interested in extending Flow.js in this way -- we'll be happy to talk about it in more detail.
