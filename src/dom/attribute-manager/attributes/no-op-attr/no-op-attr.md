 ## No-op Attributes
 *
 Flow.js provides special handling for `data-f-model` (described [here](../../../../#using_in_project)) and `data-f-convert` (described [here](../../../../converter-overview/)), and `data-f-channel`. For these attributes, the default behavior is to do nothing, so that this additional special handling can take precendence.
